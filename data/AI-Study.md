# 🧠 AI & LLM Mastery Roadmap
### 6-Month Guided Learning Journey — Theory, Practice, and Real-World Building

Welcome to the AI & LLM Learning Roadmap!  
This 6-month journey takes you from machine learning fundamentals to building and deploying advanced AI systems with tools like LangChain, OpenAI, and Hugging Face.  

We’ll learn together, meet weekly to discuss concepts, and tackle tutorials every two weeks. The course is split into **beginner** and **advanced** resources, so everyone can learn at their own depth — but all in sync.
