## 🗓️ Month 1 — Machine Learning Foundations

### **Week 1 — What is Machine Learning?**
Let’s kick things off with a solid understanding of what ML actually is. You’ll learn how algorithms find patterns in data, what makes AI “intelligent,” and the key differences between traditional software and ML systems.  
- 📘 **Beginner Reading:** [Google’s ML Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course)  
- 🔬 **Advanced Reading:** [Deep Learning Book — Chapter 1](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/)  
- 🧪 **Tutorial:** [Intro to ML in Python (Colab Notebook)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ageron/handson-ml2/blob/master/01_the_machine_learning_landscape.ipynb)

---

### **Week 2 — Data, Features & Model Training**
This week is all about how machines “see” data. You’ll learn about datasets, feature engineering, data preprocessing, and training your first ML model.  
- 📘 **Beginner Reading:** [Kaggle’s Intro to Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning)  
- 🔬 **Advanced Reading:** [Feature Engineering Principles — Google Developers](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/data-prep/construct/transform/features)  
- 🧪 **Tutorial:** [Scikit-Learn: Training Models Step-by-Step](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/basic/tutorial.html)

---

### **Week 3 — Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning**
Explore how models learn from labeled (supervised) vs. unlabeled (unsupervised) data.  
- 📘 **Beginner Reading:** [Supervised vs Unsupervised ML Explained (IBM)](https://www.ibm.com/blog/supervised-vs-unsupervised-learning/)  
- 🔬 **Advanced Reading:** [Clustering & Dimensionality Reduction — Stanford CS229 Notes](https://cs229.stanford.edu/notes2022fall/notes5.pdf)  
- 🧪 **Tutorial:** [K-Means & PCA Hands-On Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ageron/handson-ml2/blob/master/08_dimensionality_reduction.ipynb)

---

### **Week 4 — Model Evaluation & Overfitting**
You’ll learn how to measure model accuracy, precision, recall, and prevent overfitting.  
- 📘 **Beginner Reading:** [Model Evaluation Guide — Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/model-validation)  
- 🔬 **Advanced Reading:** [Bias-Variance Tradeoff (CS229 Lecture Notes)](https://cs229.stanford.edu/notes2022fall/notes3.pdf)  
- 🧪 **Tutorial:** [Evaluating ML Models — Python Walkthrough](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/understanding-bias-variance-tradeoff)
