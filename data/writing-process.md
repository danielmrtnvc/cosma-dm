# Generalized Writing Process

Writing effectively, whether it’s a resume, a blog, or creative content, can be simplified with a structured approach. Here’s a step-by-step process to keep your writing clear, concise, and impactful.

---

## **1. Start with a Framework**
Before diving in, establish the purpose and structure of your writing:
- **What are you writing?** Identify the format (e.g., resume, email, blog post, story).
- **Who is your audience?** Tailor your tone, style, and content to their expectations.
- **What’s the goal?** Define what the writing should achieve (e.g., inform, persuade, entertain).

Think of your framework as the skeleton of your piece. For example:
- Professional writing: "Role/Action/Impact" (What you did, how you did it, and the result).
- Storytelling: "Setup/Conflict/Resolution" (Build tension and resolve it).

---

## **2. Focus on Relevance**
Include only the information that serves your goal or resonates with your audience:
- **What’s essential?** Identify the main points or themes.
- **What’s unnecessary?** Remove tangents, overly complex details, or irrelevant information.

Ask yourself: "Does this add value to the overall piece?" If not, cut it.

---

## **3. Write Clearly and Concisely**
Make every word count:
- **Use active voice:** Focus on who’s doing what (e.g., "Designed a solution" vs. "A solution was designed").
- **Be action-oriented:** Use strong verbs like "improved," "spearheaded," or "developed."
- **Avoid fluff:** Eliminate filler phrases or redundancies.

### Sentence Checklist:
- Does it communicate a single idea?  
- Does it avoid unnecessary words?  
- Does it contribute to the overall flow?

---

## **4. Add Specific Details**
Specifics make your writing more engaging and credible:
- **Quantify when possible:** Add numbers, timeframes, or outcomes (e.g., "Reduced costs by 25%").  
- **Be descriptive but focused:** Use details to support the main point without overloading the reader.  

For creative writing, focus on sensory details or vivid imagery. For technical or professional writing, prioritize clarity and precision.

---

## **5. Iterate Before Finalizing**
Refine your work through small iterations:
1. Draft quickly to get ideas on the page.  
2. Step back and assess the overall flow—do the sections feel cohesive?  
3. Edit for clarity, grammar, and readability.  

If stuck, test alternative phrasings or structures. Focus on improving sections that feel unclear or overly complex.

---

## **6. Step Back and Reassess**
Take a moment to evaluate the piece as a whole:
- Does it align with the purpose you defined in the framework?  
- Is the tone consistent with the audience’s expectations?  
- Are there areas where you can simplify or strengthen your points?  

This step ensures you’re meeting your goals without overworking the piece.

---

## **7. Save Time with a Template**
For recurring types of writing, create templates to speed up the process:
- Resume bullet points: "Action + Context + Outcome."
- Emails: "Greeting + Purpose + Call to Action."
- Blog posts: "Introduction + Main Sections + Conclusion."

---

## **8. Practice and Adapt**
Over time, you’ll refine this process to fit your personal style. The more you write, the more intuitive this will become. Experiment with different approaches, but always anchor your work in purpose and clarity.

By following these steps, you’ll create writing that’s purposeful, polished, and adaptable to any context.
